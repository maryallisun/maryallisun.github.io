            <h3>The Jist</h3>
            <p>I'm Mary Allison, or MAC, if you prefer (most people do). I’m currently a senior at Miami University and preparing myself to take a leap into a new, unknown role post-graduation. As a student, I’ve held positions as a writing consultant, marketing intern, national basketball journalist, publications coordinator, copywriter, and most recently, as a media communications intern for the College of Arts and Science. You're welcome to read more about those things on my resume, though. </p>
           
            <p>Prior to beginning my senior year, I deliberately took advantage of my last "summer" as a student and, essentially, did whatever the hell I wanted. I began by joining sustainable development initiatives in Nicaragua. After that, I moved in with my brother in Manhattan while I worked for a talent management agency. Finally, feeling a bit antsy from the city, I decided to join my friend and drive cross-country from Los Angeles to Cleveland. </p>

            <p>Objectively, each of these endeavors make me proud of myself; they sound pretty cool when I stop to think about them. But none of them seemed like significant milestones while I was fumbling my way through them, calling my mom every once in a while to give her an update and hope she didn't lose it on me.

            <h4>The Nitty Gritty</h4>   
            <p>It was the in-between moments of these landmark adventures that I've found to be the most spectacular, both while they were happening and when I look back. These are also the same things which I could never list on my resume: </p>

            <p> I slept beneath palm fronds in Central America; I hammocked next to a herd of wild bison in Arizona; I convinced my Uber driver to schedule the certification test he had put off for years (while I waited outside in the car); I became pen pals with an old gay man I met in a bar; I attended every concert I could manage; I got some gnarly new scars; and, most notably, I collected a network of new inspirations that I cherish. </p>
           
            <p>These three adventures, and the hundreds between, were born out of singular moments of spontaneous courage and absolute disregard for  logistics. They tested my resourcefulness in a variety of shockingly different 'jungles,' and ultimately taught me that the most intimidating obstacle I'll face in the coming years will always be myself. </p>
            <p>Once I let go of allowing myself to find reasons not to do something, I suddenly had much better stories to tell.

            <h3>"Three First Names"</h3>
            <p>I like my name quite a lot, to tell you the truth. But the rest of the world seriously struggles with it. Despite the fact that my religiously grateful father felt compelled to formally name his daughter "Mary," my parents intended to call me "Allison". Approximately no one has ever called me "Allison" however, and I have the special pleasure of explaining myself to confused strangers daily. </p>
            <p>"Yes, I go by both. No, it's not my middle name. No, I don't have a middle name. Actually, nevermind - just write 'Casey' on the order. Thanks." </p>

            <h3>Story to tell at Parties</h3>
            <p>The two-inch 'Frankenscar' on my shin was earned by an overly-enthusiastic follow-through swing while I was helping to clear land in Nica. One of the locals rushed me to a distant clinic, where no one spoke English and the power generator happened to be out. </p>
            <p>Long story short, I sat on a counter in a pitch-black room, with stray dogs running beneath me and cats leaping above me, while a doctor held a flashlight in his mouth and stitched my leg shut. The entire process took less than fifteen minutes. And was free. </p>

            <h3>Currently Reading</h3>
            <p>"The Girls" by Emma Cline. Based on the events surrounding the Manson Family, it follows one member through her lifetime: from her insecure childhood, to her assumption as a cult member, and told from her perspective as a remorseful adult.</p>
            <p>I'm also in the process of reading, "This Changes Everything: Capitalism Vs. the Environment" by Naomi Klein. It examines how the quickening climate crisis is unable to be addressed under the present conditions of neoliberal market economies which profligate global consumption.
